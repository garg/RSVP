About

RSVP is a system designed to help the organisation of invitation responses for weddings (it is intended to also eventually apply for other events).

The basic idea is that once a user registers and lists their event they can invite guests. Each guest is assigned an invitation number (currently the primary key for the 'guests' table but it may change in the future) which they can then use to reply via a website rather than (or as well as) responding by more traditional means.

The website will also collect other data from the guest including whether they require a vegetarian meal (this could be expanded to cover other dietary requirements) or whether they will be bringing a partner (the main user has the option to disable this). The plan is to expand on this functionality to to allow the main user easy access to various metrics and make event planning simpler.
